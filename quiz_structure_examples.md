## Timing Guidelines

### Recommended Timing Structure:
- **Question Duration**: 4-6 seconds (enough to read and process)
- **Countdown Duration**: 3 seconds (1 second per number)
- **Answer Duration**: 3-5 seconds (time to reveal and celebrate)
- **CTA Duration**: 3-4 seconds (clear call-to-action)
- **Total Video Length**: 13-18 seconds (optimal for TikTok)

### Timing Best Practices:
1. **Question phase** should give viewers enough time to think
2. **Countdown phase** builds suspense - exactly 3 seconds works best
3. **Answer phase** should feel rewarding and celebratory
4. **CTA phase** should be clear and actionable

## Content Guidelines

### Question Tips:
- Keep questions simple and engaging
- Use topics that are relatable to your audience
- Make questions neither too easy nor too hard
- End with a question mark

### Answer Tips:
- Start with an emoji relevant to the topic
- Include exclamation points for excitement
- Add extra context when helpful
- Keep it concise but engaging

### CTA Tips:
- Use action words: "Follow", "Like", "Comment", "Share"
- Be specific: "Follow for more [topic] quizzes!"
- Create urgency or curiosity
- Match your content theme

## Technical Requirements

### Time Format:
- Use decimal seconds: `0.0`, `5.5`, `12.75`
- Start time must be less than end time
- No overlapping time ranges recommended
- Sequential timing works best

### Component Names:
- Must be UPPERCASE: `QUESTION`, `COUNTDOWN`, `ANSWER`, `CTA`
- Exact spelling required
- Case-sensitive

### Text Content:
- Support for emojis ‚úÖ
- Support for special characters
- Keep within reasonable length limits
- Avoid line breaks within components

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong component names**: Using `question` instead of `QUESTION`
2. **Invalid timestamps**: Using `[5-8]` instead of `[5.0-8.0]`
3. **Missing components**: Skipping COUNTDOWN or CTA
4. **Overlapping times**: Having components with conflicting timeframes
5. **Too long content**: Text that won't fit on screen properly

## Usage Example

```python
from shortGPT.engine.quiz_video_engine import QuizVideoEngine
from shortGPT.audio.edge_voice_module import EdgeTTSVoiceModule

# Create voice module
voice_module = EdgeTTSVoiceModule("en-US-AriaNeural")

# Define quiz script
quiz_script = """[0.0-5.0] QUESTION: What is the capital of France?

[8.0-12.0] ANSWER: üá´üá∑ Paris! The City of Light!
[12.0-15.0] CTA: Follow for more geography quizzes!"""

# Create quiz engine
quiz_engine = QuizVideoEngine(
    voiceModule=voice_module,
    quiz_script=quiz_script,
    watermark="YourChannel"
)

# Generate the video
for step, message in quiz_engine.makeContent():
    print(f"Step {step}: {message}")
